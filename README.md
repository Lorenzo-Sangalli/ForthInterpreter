TINY FORTH INTERPRETER

Based on Antirez's youtube C programming course.

On nov 16 '25 the implementation here presented follows the course closely until the last episode published (episode 4), 
after that it already contains some yet to be explained features.
In the future I may or may not make changes to my implemantion after seeing how the course will implement the features i added beforehand.

<h1>TINY FORTH INTERPRETER<h1>

<h2>Based on Antirez's youtube C programming course.<h2>

<p1>On nov 16 '25 the implementation here presented follows the course closely until the last episode published (episode 4), after that it already contains some yet to be explained features.<p1>

<p2>In the future I may or may not make changes to my implemantion after seeing how the course will implement the features i added beforehand, i will also surely add some features designed and implemented by myself, so this repo is not to be intended as a faithful implementation of Antirez's C programming course project.<p2>
